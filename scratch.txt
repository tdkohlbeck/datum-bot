to further reduce friction [a] allow voice transcription
datum bot needs to accept an easily spoken format
this format must allow one to easily and understandably speak a series of tags, tag-value-pairs, and any number/combination/permutation e.g.
breakfast, eggs: 2, orange juice: 1, toast
we must recognize breaks between tags, tags with values, and multi-word tags ('orange juice')
scratch:
breakfast and eggs is two and orange juice is 1 and toast
exercise and push ups is 20 and pull ups is 5 and wide push ups is 22
exercise and push ups is 6
i think i got it
datum bot should parse the sentence, then convert it to the correct arguments for datum cli
breakfast eggs:2 'orange juice':1 toast
and -> space
is -> colon
tag with spaces -> underscore



[a] the combination of two measures: 1) the time it takes to input a datum, from front pocket to database and 2) the effort expended navigating UIs

DONE handle dashes
TODO catch and convert fractions

test_datum, long:list, ..., id:morning_pills

datum add id:morning_pills
datum add datum morning-pills (sugar)
datum add datum 63
or
datum add 63 (?)
datum add morning-pills (doesn't work)
datum add _index:63
datum add _id:morning-pills (datum data) (metadata) (metadatum)
same value or same reference?
id is value
_ is reference (THAT datum)

datum add id:morning_pills b6:500mg (add tag to the datum)
datum add datum

if you specify an identifier, name, number, etc.
you can add a datum with just that id, and it will in essence
be adding that same datum. id speaks for a datum
a special tag

DONE use rsync instead of syncjs
